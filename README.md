# Description
The Weather web app was created to practice API usage. To make my weather dashboard to look different and interesting weather data is displayed isometrically to give user a 3D feel. I will soon rewrite it using React.

# Key features
- Shows weather for the specified city for the next 7 days.
- Users can input city manually or allow app to locate them.
- The temperature can be displayed in either F or C.
- Uses OpenWeather and Geolocation API data.
- Displays real time.
- Data is displayed isometrically on top of a looped video background.
